## BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6
### You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for riscv64-softmmu.  Once they are installed, and in your shell search path, you can run "make qemu".

## useful commands:
```
xv6 has no ps command, but, if you type Ctrl-p, the kernel will print information about each process. If you try it now, you'll see two lines: one for init, and one for sh.

To quit qemu type: Ctrl-a x (press Ctrl and a at the same time, followed by x).
```
