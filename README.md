## the key points are as follows:
```
1. use these 2 bits in PTE: 
#define PTE_RSW_9 (1L << 9) 
#define PTE_RSW_8 (1L << 8) 

PTE_RSW_9 bit indicates whether it is a COW page,
if it is a COW page, then PTE_RSW_8 bit indicates whether it is originally writeable

2. so there are 2 kinds of pages, one kind is the COW pages, the other kind
is the normal pages. If it is a COW page, then take care to handle 
reference_count_of_pages[i], otherwise just ignore reference_count_of_pages[i]
```
