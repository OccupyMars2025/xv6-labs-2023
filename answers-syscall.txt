Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?

kernel/trap.c: usertrap()

============
What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? (Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)

7

==============
What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?

0, user mode
================
Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the variable num?

lw	a3,0(zero)
num corresponds to register a3
==============
Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? Is that confirmed by the value in scause above? 
(See description of scause in RISC-V privileged instructions)

address 0 is not mapped.
scause = 0x000000000000000d means "Load page fault"
===============
What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)?

(gdb) p p->name 
$3 = "initcode\000\000\000\000\000\000\000"
(gdb) p p->pid 
$4 = 1
